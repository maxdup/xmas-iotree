# xmas-iotree

This project offers a straightforward Python runtime designed for managing positional LED sequences on Raspberry Pi controllers. It features a machine vision workflow for 3D LED position mapping, an intuitive runtime for creating dynamic LED sequences, and a webapp for uploading and switching between different LED sequences.

(This project was originally designed for setting up a Christmas tree with individually addressable LEDs. But it should work well enough for any 2D or 3D LED arrangement)
